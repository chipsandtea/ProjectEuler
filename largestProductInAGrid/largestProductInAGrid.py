# Problem 11: What is the greatest product of four adjacent numbers in the same direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) in the 20Ã—20 grid?

# Data Structure: 2D Array
# Movement through 2D Array
# Up/Left: [i--][j++]  -  Up: [i--][j]  -  Up/Right: [i--][j++]

# Down/Left: [i++][j--] - Down: [i++][j] - Down/Right: [i++][j++]
